# im.riot.Riot

This is a community-maintained [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) distribution of [Element Desktop](https://github.com/element-hq/element-desktop/), [formerly](https://element.io/blog/the-world-is-changing/) called Riot.

## User-specified config.json

Element Desktop's [instructions](https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/#user-specified-configjson) to use user-specified configuration settings do not apply. Instead, `config.json` must be created at `~/.var/app/im.riot.Riot/config/$NAME/config.json`, where `$NAME` is typically `Element`. The contents of the file are otherwise the same.
